Hi there! 
I am a full-stack web developer with years of experience creating functional and reliable web applications. I have worked with various frameworks including Django, CodeIgniter, and Odoo. I have developed web applications for different industries such as medicine, education, and advertisement. 
Additionally, I specialize in systems integration using Django REST API and SOAP servers to establish data pipelines between systems. I love taking on new projects and learning about new technologies.
